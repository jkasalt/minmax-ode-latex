The starting point is a second order dynamical system that combines a vanishing damping term with the time derivative of \$V\$ along the trajectory. Our method exhibits fast convergence rates of order \$o \textbackslash left( \textbackslash frac\{1\}\{t\textbackslash beta(t)\} \textbackslash right)\$ for \$\textbackslash |V(z(t))\textbackslash |\$, and \$\textbackslash beta(\textbackslash cdot)\$ is a nondecreasing function satisfiyng a growth condition, and also for the restricted gap function, which is a measure of optimality for variational inequalities. We also prove the weak convergence of the trajectory to a zero of \$V\$. Temporal discretizations generate implicit and explicit numerical algorithms, which can be both seen as accelerated versions of the Optimistic Gradient Descent Ascent (OGDA) method, for which we prove that the generated sequence of iterates shares the asymptotic features of the continuous dynamics. In particular we show for the implicit numerical algorithm convergence rates of order \$o \textbackslash left( \textbackslash frac\{1\}\{k\textbackslash beta\_k\} \textbackslash right)\$ for \$\textbackslash |V(z\^k)\textbackslash |\$ and the restricted gap function, where \$(\textbackslash beta\_k)\_\{k \textbackslash geq 0\}\$ is a nondecreasing sequence satisfying a growth condition. For the explicit numerical algorithm we show by additionally assuming that the operator \$V\$ is Lipschitz continuous convergence rates of order \$o \textbackslash left( \textbackslash frac\{1\}\{k\} \textbackslash right)\$ for \$\textbackslash |V(z\^k)\textbackslash |\$ and the restricted gap function. All convergence rate statements are last iterate convergence results; in addition to these we prove for both algorithms the convergence of the iterates to a zero of \$V\$. To our knowledge, our study exhibits the best known convergence rate results for monotone equations. Numerical experiments indicate the overwhelming superiority of our explicit numerical algorithm over other methods for monotone equations.},

To our knowledge, this is the first continuous-time dynamics shown to converge for such a general setting. We also provid{$\surd$}e an implicit discretization of our ODE and we show it has last iterate convergence at a rate O(1/ T ), which was previously shown to be optimal [Golowich et al., 2020], using only first-order smoothness of the monotone operator, in contrast to previous results that need second-order smoothness as well.},

  abstract = {Many problems in machine learning and game theory can be formulated as saddlepoint problems, for which various first-order methods have been developed and proven efficient in practice. Under the general convex-concave assumption, most first-order methods only guarantee an ergodic convergence rate, that is, the uniform averages of the iterates converge at a O(1/T ) rate in terms of the saddle-point residual. However, numerically, the iterates themselves can often converge much faster than the uniform averages. This observation motivates increasing averaging schemes that put more weight on later iterates, in contrast to the usual uniform averaging. We show that such increasing averaging schemes, applied to various firstorder methods, are able to preserve the O(1/T ) convergence rate with no additional assumptions or computational overhead. Extensive numerical experiments on zero-sum game solving, market equilibrium computation and image denoising demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes. In particular, the increasing averages consistently outperform the uniform averages in all test problems by orders of magnitude. When solving matrix and extensive-form games, increasing averages consistently outperform the last iterates as well. For matrix games, a first-order method equipped with increasing averaging outperforms the highly competitive CFR+ algorithm.},

In this paper, we resolve one of such questions and derive the first last-iterate O(1/K) convergence rate for EG for monotone and Lipschitz VIP without any additional assumptions on the operator unlike the only known result of this type (Golowich et al., 2020b) that relies on the Lipschitzness of the Jacobian of the operator. The rate is given in terms of reducing the squared norm of the operator.

In this paper, we study the limiting behaviors of three classic minimax algorithms: gradient descent ascent (GDA), alternating gradient descent ascent (AGDA), and the extragradient method (EGM). Numerically, we observe that all of these limiting behaviors can arise in Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) training and are easily demonstrated even in simple GAN models. To explain these different behaviors, we study the high-order resolution continuous-time dynamics that correspond to each algorithm, which results in sufficient (and almost necessary) conditions for the local convergence by each method. Moreover, this ODE perspective allows us to characterize the phase transition between these potentially nonconvergent limiting behaviors caused by introducing regularization in the problem instance.},

The scale of these applications naturally leads to the use of first-order methods.

Recently, it was shown that the Proximal Point Method (PPM) converges linearly for a family of nonconvex-nonconcave problems. In this paper, we study the convergence of a damped version of Extra-Gradient Method (EGM) which avoids potentially costly proximal computations, only relying on gradient evaluation.

On that account, we take an in-depth look at a comprehensive class of state-of-the art algorithms and prevalent heuristics in non-convex / non-concave problems, and we establish the following general results: a) generically, the algorithms' limit points are contained in the internally chain-transitive (ICT) sets of a common, mean-field system; b) the attractors of this system also attract the algorithms in question with arbitrarily high probability; and c) all algorithms avoid the system's unstable sets with probability 1. On the surface, this provides a highly optimistic outlook for min-max algorithms; however, we show that there exist spurious attractors that do not contain any stationary points of the problem under study. In this regard, our work suggests that existing min-max algorithms may be subject to inescapable convergence failures. We complement our theoretical analysis by illustrating such attractors in simple, two-dimensional, almost bilinear problems.},

This approach formulates the marginal distributions of multivariate failure times with the familiar Cox proportional hazards models while leaving the nature of dependence among related failure times completely unspecified. The baseline hazard functions for the marginal models may be identical or different. Simple estimating equations for the regression parameters are developed which yield consistent and asymptotically normal estimators, and robust variance-covarinace estimators are constructed to account for the intra-class correlation. Simulation results demonstrate that the large-sample approximations are adequate for practical use and that ignoring the intra-class correlation could yield rather misleading variance estimators. The proposed methodology has been fully implemented in a simple computer program which also incorporates several alternative approaches. Detailed illustrations with data from four clinical or epidemiologic studies are provided.},

In this paper, we propose a new machinery \textendash{} an O(sr)-resolution ODE framework \textendash{} for analyzing the behavior of a generic DTA, which (partially) answers the above two questions. The framework contains three steps: 1. To obtain a suitable ODE from a given DTA, we define a hierarchy of O(sr)-resolution ODEs of a DTA parameterized by the degree r, where s is the step-size of the DTA. We present a principal approach to construct the unique O(sr)-resolution ODEs from a DTA; 2. To analyze the resulting ODE, we propose the O(sr)-linear-convergence condition of a DTA with respect to an energy function, under which the O(sr)-resolution ODE converges linearly to an optimal solution; 3. To bridge the convergence properties of a DTA and its corresponding ODEs, we define the properness of an energy function and show that the linear convergence of the O(sr)-resolution ODE with respect to a proper energy function can automatically guarantee the linear convergence of the DTA.},

  abstract = {The instability of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) training has frequently been attributed to gradient descent. Consequently, recent methods have aimed to tailor the models and training procedures to stabilise the discrete updates. In contrast, we study the continuous-time dynamics induced by GAN training. Both theory and toy experiments suggest that these dynamics are in fact surprisingly stable. From this perspective, we hypothesise that instabilities in training GANs arise from the integration error in discretising the continuous dynamics. We experimentally verify that well-known ODE solvers (such as Runge-Kutta) can stabilise training \textendash{} when combined with a regulariser that controls the integration error. Our approach represents a radical departure from previous methods which typically use adaptive optimisation and stabilisation techniques that constrain the functional space (e.g. Spectral Normalisation). Evaluation on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet shows that our method outperforms several strong baselines, demonstrating its efficacy.},

  abstract = {Gradient-based optimization algorithms can be studied from the perspective of limiting ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Motivated by the fact that existing ODEs do not distinguish between two fundamentally different algorithms\textemdash Nesterov's accelerated gradient method for strongly convex functions (NAG-SC) and Polyak's heavy-ball method\textemdash we study an alternative limiting process that yields high-resolution ODEs. We show that these ODEs permit a general Lyapunov function framework for the analysis of convergence in both continuous and discrete time. We also show that these ODEs are more accurate surrogates for the underlying algorithms; in particular, they not only distinguish between NAG-SC and Polyak's heavy-ball method, but they allow the identification of a term that we refer to as ``gradient correction'' that is present in NAG-SC but not in the heavy-ball method and is responsible for the qualitative difference in convergence of the two methods. We also use the high-resolution ODE framework to study Nesterov's accelerated gradient method for (non-strongly) convex functions, uncovering a hitherto unknown result\textemdash that NAG-C minimizes the squared gradient norm at an inverse cubic rate. Finally, by modifying the high-resolution ODE of NAG-C, we obtain a family of new optimization methods that are shown to maintain the accelerated convergence rates of NAG-C for smooth convex functions.},

Assuming the factorization is known, we propose two model-based algorithms. The first one achieves minimax optimal regret guarantees for a rich class of factored structures, while the second one enjoys better computational complexity with a slightly worse regret. A key new ingredient of our algorithms is the design of a bonus term to guide exploration. We complement our algorithms by presenting several structure-dependent lower bounds on regret for FMDPs that reveal the difficulty hiding in the intricacy of the structures.},

Using this theorem the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs partial differential equation associated with differential games is represented by a system of forward-backward stochastic differential equations. Numerical solution of the aforementioned system of stochastic differential equations is performed using importance sampling and a neural network with Long Short-Term Memory and Fully Connected layers. The resulting algorithm is tested on two example systems in simulation and compared against the standard risk neutral stochastic optimal control formulations.},

Min Max Optimization is an approach that returns optima that are robust against worst case conditions. We propose algorithms that perform Min Max Optimization in a setting where the function that should be optimized is not known a priori and hence has to be learned by experiments. Therefore we extend the Bayesian Optimization setting, which is tailored to maximization problems, to Min Max Optimization problems. While related work extends the two acquisition functions Expected Improvement and Gaussian Process Upper Confidence Bound; we extend the two acquisition functions Entropy Search and Knowledge Gradient. These acquisition functions are able to gain knowledge about the optimum instead of just looking for points that are supposed to be optimal. In our evaluation we show that these acquisition functions allow for better solutions - converging faster to the optimum than the benchmark settings.},

Importantly, the deterrence effect of patrols on adversaries' future behavior makes patrol planning a sequential decision-making problem. Therefore, we focus on robust sequential patrol planning for green security following the minimax regret criterion, which has not been considered in the literature. We formulate the problem as a game between the defender and nature who controls the parameter values of the adversarial behavior and design an algorithm MIRROR to find a robust policy. MIRROR uses two reinforcement learning\textendash based oracles and solves a restricted game considering limited defender strategies and parameter values. We evaluate MIRROR on real-world poaching data.},
